Hello and welcome! My name is Marion Marschalek, I'm a security engineer 
with a deep passion for reverse engineering, and have been in this field 
since 2011. I hold a bachelors and masters degree in Information Security 
from University of Applied Sciences St. Poelten, Austria. Thats also where 
I'm from, Austria. Its a beautiful country, you should go visit. 
I started my career in anti-virus with the Austrian AV company Ikarus. 
As a malware analyst I discovered my passion for binary analysis, learned
how reverse engineering malware in reality is like building puzzles. I 
also spent time in incident response, and later switched to offensive 
security and cloud security. I spent three wonderful years working for
Intel's STORM team in Oregon, learning about vulnerabilities on a 
hardware level. I joined AWS in 2020, to focus on threat detection in 
the cloud, and worked with the AWS GuardDuty team for four years fending
off Linux focussed cloud attacks.  <br>
In February 2025 I decided to venture out on my own, and here we are,
Hack & Cheese was born. Hack & Cheese is my professional outlet to offer
reverse engineering consulting and training services. Contact me with any
inquiries.
