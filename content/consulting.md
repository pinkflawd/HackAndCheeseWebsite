summary: what I have to offer

##Malware Analysis

I have 13 years of experience in x86-64 reverse engineering, where my main focus is malware on 
Windows and Linux systems. I am comfortable with ARM architecture binaries and mobile reverse engineering as 
well. I can assist in incident response cases, and post-incident investigation, optionally
also in research endeavors. I offer initial assessments for free, to evaluate project volume and timeline. 

##Other Reverse Engineering Projects

I'll happily dive into other reverse engineering projects as well, with goals such as vulnerability discovery
 or source code recovery. Please feel free to inquire whether your project fits my skill set. 

##Threat Detection Consulting

With ample experience in Windows and Linux threat detection technologies, including anti-virus software and 
large scale malware detection systems, sandboxing solutions, and runtime threat detection, I'd be happy to 
help you with assessments of existing solutions and design of new ones.

##Trainings and Education

I'm a passionate teacher and have been teaching reverse engineering and malware analysis continuously since
2012, including a University course, countless free classes under the banner of BlackHoodie, and various 
industry trainings at company sites and conferences. Please check out the Training section on this website.
