summary: what trainings can I offer
---

I'm a passionate teacher with over a decade of experience in teaching malware analysis and reverse engineering
related topics. I love learning, and likewise passing on that knowledge to the next generation. I have seen 
former students take their learned skills far beyond what I could have ever taught them, and there is nothing 
more exhilarating. <br>
What I can currently offer is listed below, and please keep in mind that modifications to curriculums can be made
relatively easily.

### Advanced Linux Malware Reverse Engineering

1-day, 2-day or 4-day options available, customers can choose topics for 1- and 2-day options. 

#### Abstract

This fast-paced course will make students familiar with reverse engineering Linux malware, starting
off with a dense walk through of Linux OS internals and Linux binary analysis techniques, before jumping
right in with common Linux malware. Quickly we'll work our way to advanced samples, targeted malware, Linux
software protection techniques and packers. We will cover Go malware, Rust, and C++ samples, and explore recent
rootkits targetting Linux.<br>
Students will walk away with a deep understanding of Linux binary analysis techniques and knowledge
of the Linux threat landscape, being able to dissect advanced Linux malware in their day to day
operation.

#### Description

Day 1 <br>
Familiarization with analysis environment using introduction malware<br>
Linux specific reverse engineering concepts, Linux OS internals and ELF file format<br>
Compiling, linking, loading, process execution<br>
Practice learned skills on a selection of DDoS bots, bitcoin miners, and ransomware, the Linux most-wanted<br>

Day 2 <br>
Dynamic analysis of malicious software on Linux, tool internals and techniques<br>
C++ reverse engineering with Linux malware examples from real world attacks<br>
Go and Rust reverse engineering of Linux malware, such as Luna and BlackCat ransomwares<br>

Day 3 <br>
Linux analysis evasion tricks, packers, process injection techniques<br>
Hands on unpacking and evasive sample analysis<br>
Linux rootkits and eBPF based malware such as Diamorphine, Phalanx2, and Symbiote<br>

Day 4 <br>
Targeted Linux malware samples, cases like Turla and BVP47<br>
Advanced analysis automation techniques using eBPF and Frida<br>
